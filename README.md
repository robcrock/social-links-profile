## My process

Coming soon. I'm slowly refining the process.

### Built with

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### What I learned

Overriding the system theme is still a challenge for me. I don't know if the issue is caused by NextJS or Shadcn, but it's definitely something I need to look into more closely.

### Continued development

I want to continue refining my process and deepening my knowledge of the tools I'm using for these developments.
